# LAMP_Learning

Repository containing simple examples (which will get progressively more elaborate) involving development with a LAMP stack, 
without the use of any framework so that people can grasp the foundations of web development.

This is by no means a self explanatory course and is only a support material for other courses, 
where people might reproduce the contents of this repository partial or in full.
